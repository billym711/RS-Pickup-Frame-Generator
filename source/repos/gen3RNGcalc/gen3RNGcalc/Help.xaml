Well, you've come to the right place!"/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The first box is where you input what is known as the &quot;initial seed&quot;. The initial seed is the first value that is used by the RNG function when it starts to generate &quot;random&quot; numbers. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, this value is created based on the date and time, with the value always being set to 0x05A0 if the date battery has run dry, in Pokémon Emerald, it is always set to 0x0000, and if you start a new game, the value is set to your trainer ID when it is generated. In Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green, however, the generation of this initial seed is a bit more complicated, being based on an internal counter that is ran by the CPU, counting each frame and incrementing the value on each frame when the game starts up. Similarly to Emerald, Fire Red and Leaf Green also set the initial RNG value to your trainer ID if you start a new game."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" - How do I find the initial seed?"/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="If you are playing Ruby or Sapphire, the value will always be 0x05A0 if the battery is dead, but if it is not, then you just add 1 to this value for every minute that the battery has been installed, or on emulator, add 1 for each minute past January 1st, 2000 at 00:00 (12:00 AM). If you are using emulator, the program has a built-in seed finder for Ruby/Sapphire accessable by clicking &quot;R/S Seed Finder&quot;. On Emerald, as stated above, the value is always 0x0000 if you are not starting a new game, and if you do start a new game, the value is set to your trainer ID when it is generated. In Fire Red and Leaf Green, you can manually search for what the value is in memory if you are not starting a new game, the value being a 2 byte number located at the offset 0x02020000 in VBA's memory viewer, and at 0x20000 in EWRAM in Bizhawk's memory viewer, or you can look at what your trainer ID is if you started a new game."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" - What should I put for the minimum/maximum frame?"/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="In order to find out what RNG frame you are on, the easiest way is to monitor the RNG values directly, done easiest with some Lua scripts made by mkdasher, located at https://github.com/mkdasher/PokemonBizhawkLua. The minimum frame should usually just be around the frame you want to find, and the maximum should be whatever number you want that is larger than the minimum frame."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" - What do the check boxes for searching for crits and rolls do?"/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The generation 3 Pokémon games are relatively simple in regards to how they determine if an attack is a critical hit and what modifier is applied to the damage formula. Provided that the move or Pokémon battling does not have any modifiers to the critical hit ratio, if the 3rd number in the hexadecimal RNG value generated on the frame crits are determined is 0, then the attack will result in a critical hit. Similarly, the 3rd number in the hexadecimal RNG value is also used to determine the damage modifier, multiplying the calculated damage by (100-value)/100, resulting in the value being anything from 1x damage to .85x damage. This program generates the 2 random numbers either 5 (if you select Fire Red/Leaf Green), or 7 (if you select Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald) RNG values apart to determine the crit roll pairs that the game will generate. The application does not currently have a standalone setting for finding rolls, but this will be added in the future."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text=" - What is the minimum roll box?"/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The minimum roll box is where you input whatever the minimum damage roll you want to find is, used if you have the box for searching for rolls checked."/></TextBlock>
