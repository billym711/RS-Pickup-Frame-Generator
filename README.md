This is a very simple application to use. I made it mainly because I couldn't find any application where I could specify the exact RNG frame of Pokemon Fire Red given the starting seed and get all of the results without going through a bunch of extra stuff.

Basically, just follow all the prompts that the terminal application gives, filling in the exact hex value of the starting seed, the number of frames you want to calculate, and typing yes or anything else into the prompt to calculate crits only.

The program just checks if the first letter in your response to the prompt to calculate crits only is either "y" or "Y", having the first letter be anything else, will just assume that you do not want to calculate crits only, and will display all results. A quick thing to note is that this program is still very much in alpha stages, so if you don't type anything on the question to calculate crits, the application crashes.
