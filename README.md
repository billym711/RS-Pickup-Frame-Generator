This is a very simple application to use. I made it mainly because I couldn't find any application where I could specify the exact RNG frame of Pokemon Fire Red given the starting seed and get all of the results without going through a bunch of extra stuff.

Basically, just follow all the prompts that the terminal application gives, filling in the exact hex value of the starting seed, the number of frames you want to calculate, and typing yes or anything else into the prompt to calculate crits only and then doing the same thing for whether you only want to display crit max damage pairs if you answered yes to calculating crits only.

The program just checks if the first letter in your response to the prompt to calculate crits only is either "y" or "Y", having the first letter be anything else will just assume that you do not want to calculate crits only, and will display all results. A quick thing to note is that this program is still very much in alpha stages, so if you don't type anything on the question to calculate crits or the question to display crit max damage pairs, the application crashes.

Because all of the gen 3 GBA Pokemon games use the same formula to calculate RNG as well as having the same way to determine if an attack is a crit and determine damage roll multipliers, this RNG calculator should work with any of the GBA games, including Ruby, Sapphire, Fire Red, Leaf Green, and Emerald. All you need for it to work is the initial RNG seed.
